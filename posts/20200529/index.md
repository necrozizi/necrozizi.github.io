# Solar's new power (Part.03)

> Not all perovskites are semiconductors. But a group based on a metal, such as **tin**, and a **halogen**, such as chlorine, **bromine** or **iodine**, do have that property. The **ingredients** of these metal-**halide** perovskites are, **moreover**, abundant and inexpensive. One of the leaders in the field of making cells out of them is Oxford PV, a British firm founded in 2010 to **exploit** work done on perovskites by Henry Snaith of Oxford University. The firm's design is a **hybrid** structure, known as a **tandem** cell, that coats a silicon layer with perovskite.

> This brings two advantages. One is that, like a multilayered Ⅲ-Ⅴ cell, a perovskite-sillicon tandem cell divides up the job of capturing sunlight. The upper, perovskite, layer is **tweaked** to absorb light from the blue end of the spectrum. The lower, silicon, layer **mops up** the remaining wave-lengths towards the red end. This makes for high efficiency. In a test in 2018 such a tandem cell **set a new record** for its type with an efficiency of 28%. Eventually, the firm's engineers think, they can push this into the "mid-30s".

> The second advantage of **piggybacking** the perovskite on silicon is that the cells are fairly easy to make into **solar panels** using standard industrial processes. That helps keep them competitive with **conventional** solar panels. A new factory that will do just this is currently under construction in Germany. The hope is that─the pandemic provided─the first panels made in this plant will go on sale next year.

> Whether an efficiency in the mid-30s will be enough to displace silicon cells from part of their existing market remains to be seen. Perovskites may, however, have applications doing jobs that silicon cannot manage. For instance, they work well in low light **intensities**. This has permitted a group led by Thomas Brown of Tor Bergata University of Rome and John Fahlteich of the Fraunhofer Institute's campus in Dresden, Germany, to develop versions which operate at the levels of illumination found inside buildings. The amount of energy in artificial lighting is **vastly** less than that in sunshine. **Nevertheless**, Dr Brown and Dr Fahlteich have found, according to a paper they published this month in Cell Reports Physical Science, that their cells can achieve a **conversion** efficiency of up to 22.6% thereby producing enough **juice** to run small, low-power devices like wireless sensors and remote-control units, which would otherwise require batteries.

> Though it may seem odd to turn artificial, indoor lighting into electricity, **given** that it has been created from electricity in the first place, the truth is that all such light which does not end up entering a human eye is wasted. This approach simply reduces the level of waste. With the growth of the so-called **internet of things**, which relies on many different types of sensors, wireless control systems and other **bits** of electronic **kit**, such an approach could have wide application. If it works, the label "batteries not included" will go from being a warning to a recommendation.
