    <description><![CDATA[One way to boost a cell&rsquo;s efficiency is to add layers tuned to different parts of the solar spectrum. This means reaching beyond silicon to other materials.

At the moment this happened that represented almost 30% of the country&rsquo;s electricity sup]]></description>
