> Spain announced a complicated four-phase, eight-week return to a "new normality", which will vary in speed between provinces. If all goes well, **Spaniards** will be able to return to beaches and bars by the end of June, and in some places before then. France also outlined its own "**deconfinement**" strategy. Most businesses will be allowed to reopen from May 11th, except for cafés, restaurants and large public spaces such as museums; pulic transport will largely resume too. The French prime minister said this was necessary to avoid economic collapse. France also suffered some **alarming** instances of **rioting**.

> The chief executive of **Heathrow** called for the **mandatory** testing of passengers for covid-19 at airports in Britain, because travellers are currently allowed to enter the country "without **visible** measures in place". Britain is one of only a few countries not to have introduced tighter border screening. Following scientific advice, the government has concluded that temperature checks are ineffective.

> In **El Salvador** the president, Nayib Bukele, encouraged police to use "**lethal** force" against criminals following dozens of murders over a few days. The country's **homicide** rate, one of the world's highest, has fallen since Mr Bukele became president in June. He accused gangs of taking advantage of the pandemic, which has distracted security forces from fighting crime.
