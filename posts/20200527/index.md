# Solar's new power (Part.01)


{{<music url="/economist/20200523/080 Science and technology - Photovoltaics/1.mp3">}}

> Solar energy has had a **good crisis**. In many parts of the world skies **clear** of pollution have helped **photovoltaic** power stations, which convert light into electricity, become more productive and reliable. **Declining** demand, meanwhile, has seen coal- and gas-fired stations taken offline. In Britain, on April 20th, solar **generation** peaked at 9.7 gigawatts. At the moment this happened that represented almost 30% of the country's electricity supply─ten times the usual **proportion**. In Germany the proportion of solar in the mix reached 23% for an entire week in April, compared with an average of about 8% during 2019.

> Though temporary, such **figures** are impressive. Solar power, they suggest, has **come of age**. In some ways, however, despite solar's new and shiny image, this is the victory of an old technology.

- figure
  - （代表数量，尤指官方资料中的）数字
- come of age
  - if sth comes of age, it reaches the stage of development at which people accept and value it 成熟，发达

> The first **practical** **solar cell** was made in the 1950s at Bell Labs in New Jersey. It had an efficiency of 6% and was **horrendously** expensive. It did, though, prove to have a killer application in powering the **satellites** of the **superpowers** in the forthcoming space race. That kept interest alive.

> Gradually, costs came down, efficiencies **tripled** to 17-20% and applications widened, until the point, now arrived at, where **grid** managers faced with **surplus** capacity are preferring solar to fossil-fuel generation. **For all that** they have got better in detail, though, solar cells have stayed the same in principle. Two layers of **ultrapure** (99.9999%) **silicon**, each **doped** with an **additive** to make it semiconducting, absorb light and use the energy from this to move electrons across the junction between them, thus generating an electric current.

> For gridscale electricity produced in standard solar farms this arrangement is likely to continue. But many people think solar energy has wider potential than that. Some want to redesign solar farms in **radical** ways. Others see it as having small-scale applications that do not require connection to a grid. Both of these approaches will require **efficiencies** that standard silicon has never managed to achieve. But both will permit high prices for cells that do so.
