> **Fortress** China
> 
> With most of its newly confirmed cases of covid-19 now being found among travellers from abroad, China closed its borders to most foreigners. On a visit to Zhejiang province, President Xi Jinping said **curbing** imported cases, which mostly involve returning Chinese citizens, had become the "most important" task in the country's fight against the virus and could remain so "for a long period". State media **coverage** of the trip showed Mr Xi without a mask; he had always worn one on previous **outings** during the crisis.

> India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, apologised for the suffering he caused by locking down the country with so little preparation. Millions of **migrant workers** struggled to get home to their villages. Many crowded into transport **hubs**, making social distancing impossible. Videos **emerged** of police beating people who broke the **quarantine** laws.

> Japan **reaffirmed** its 2015 goal to reduce greenhouse-gas **emissions** by 26% by 2030 based on levels from 2013, disappointing **environmentalists** who want it to cut deeper and faster. Japan is the only G7 country still building coal-fired **power stations**.

> Meanwhile, this November's UN climate-change **summit**, COP26, was **postponed** until next year. The talks, which are expected to speed up action on reducing emissions, will still take place in Glasgow.
