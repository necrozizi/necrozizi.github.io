# Solar's new power (Part.02)

> One way to boost a cell's efficiency is to add layers **tuned** to different parts of the solar **spectrum**. This means reaching beyond silicon to other materials. So-called Ⅲ-Ⅴ semiconductors, made of elements from group Ⅲ of the **periodic table** (aluminium, **gallium** and **indium**) and group Ⅴ (phosphorus and **arsenic**) are one approach. Indeed, gallium arsenide is already used in applications like satellites. John Geisz and his colleagues at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, in Colorado, have produced a six-junction cell containing various Ⅲ-Ⅴ mixtures, each with different light-absorbing properties. This cell has an efficiency of 47.1% in laboratory conditions─a new record, which the researchers reported in Nature Energy in April. Whith further work, they **reckon**, an efficiency of more than 50% should be possible.

> **Intriguingly**, the efficiency of Dr Geisz's cell rises as more light is concentrated on it. **Laid out** in standard solar farms it would manage a bit under 40%. The 47% figure comes when it is bathed in **illumination** equivalent to 143 suns. Roughly speaking, then, a six-junction cell with a suitable arrangement of mirrors concentrating the sun's light onto it could turn out the same amount of electricity as a standard silicon cell that had 400 times the area. Those are the sorts of numbers that **disruptive** technologies are made of.

> Another **promising** group of materials for making new types of solar cells are **perovskites**. The original substance of this name is a mineral, calcium titanium oxide, discovered in the Ural mountains in 1839 and called after Count Lev Perovski, a Russian **mineralogist**. As is often the way with minerals, though, the basic **crystal lattice** involved can be created from many sorts of atoms. "Perovskite" has thus now become a **generic** term for any of these variants.
