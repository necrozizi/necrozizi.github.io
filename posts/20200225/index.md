> "It is going to be an **almighty** legal mess for months and years to come." That **grim** **prognosis** of the potential legal and business consequences of the viral outbreak in China comes from a **veteran** of the country's **business scene**. Dan Harris of Harris Bricken, an American law firm, worries that today's **trickle** of mainland suppliers declaring **force majeure** (FM), an obscure legal **manoeuvre** used to get out of contracts, could turn into a **tidal wave**.

> The crisis has certainly put many firms in a **bind**. If this were a normal year, most factories would have shut for a week **or so** in early February so that **migrant workers** could return to their villages to celebrate Chinese new year. By now, plants would be **roaring** at full **capacity**. But because of a lockdown of a large area around Wuhan, the outbreak's centre, and ongoing restrictions on travel, workers are only slowly trickling back. Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, reckons that production may reach only 60% to 80% of normal levels by the end of February.

> The result is that the supply chains of global firms, which often rely on "**just in time**" deliveries of stocks, are being disrupted. Chinese buyers of imported **commodities** are also hurt, thanks to weak local demand. Nomura, a Japanese bank, thinks Chinese **year-on-year** economic growth could **plunge** to 3% in the first quarter, down from 6% the previous quarter.

> China Inc is **panicking**. Firms are starting to **invoke** FM to avoid paying non-performance **penalties** on contracts. On February 17th, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), an official body, revealed that it had already **issued** over 1,600 "FM certificates" to firms in 30 **sectors** covering contracts worth over $15bn. These give official support to its **invocation**. More are likely to come.

> All this raises several questions. First, since this **clause** typically refers to "acts of God" like earthquakes and **hurricanes**, does it really apply to an epidemic probably caused by humans eating **exotic** animals and to the **heavy-handed** government response to it? Second, even if **deemed** relevant, will FM really work in practice? And finally, is a **lengthy** legal **tangle** inevitable?

> On the first question, common sense suggests no but **precedent** and **officialdom** say yes. David Buxbaum of Anderson & Anderson, a lawyer who has worked in China since 1972, reports that some suppliers successfully invoked FM in local courts **in the wake of** the SARS virus outbreak of 2003. On February 10th, the National People's Congress **ruled** that policies **implemented** to control the virus (such as production **curbs** and city lockdowns) that interfere with contracts should be considered FM.

> On whether invoking this clause will really work, legal opinion is divided. Many trading contracts fall under international **jurisdictions** less friendly to this claim than China with courts not overly **impressed** by FM certificates. Earlier this month, CNOOC, a Chinese state-run oil firm, invoked FM in refusing to accept a **shipment** of **liquefied natural gas** from Royal Dutch Shell and Total—a claim rejected by the European oil giants. Traders whisper that mainland firms are using the viral outbreak to try to **renegotiate** terms, a tactic they deride as "price majeure."

> "FM is a recognised **doctrine** in **civil-law** systems like that of China but is not a doctrine of **common-law** systems, like English law," observes Simmons+Simmons, a British law firm. It is typically only respected by courts in London and Hong Kong if the contract has a specific FM clause. So local firms are likely to get a more **sympathetic** **hearing** in mainland courts. Mr Harris thinks that even if a foreign firm gets a favourable **ruling** overseas, it may still need to get it enforced by a Chinese court. That court will see the FM certificate and likely **rule for** the mainland firm.

> Tobias Larsson of Resilience360, a German supply-chain **consultancy**, thinks that invocation of FM could help make the **fallout** from the virus the "biggest supply-chain disruption since Japan's earthquake." Mayer Brown, an American law firm, worries that use of FM and other legal tactics "may be **passed along** supply chains around the world, causing firms based in other jurisdiction to seek similar relief."

> Still, there is a reason to think legal chaos might be avoided. Unlike during the SARS epidemic, when multinationals could easily shift **sourcing**, Chinese firms are now critical (and sometimes the only) suppliers of vital parts to many industries. John Hoffecker of Alix Partners, a consultancy, says that his clients are more concerned about being the first to receive parts as factories restart than about FM. So foreign bosses may agree to renegotiate terms with certificate-waving **vendors** through **gritted teeth** rather than risk losing them altogether through **bitter** legal battles.
