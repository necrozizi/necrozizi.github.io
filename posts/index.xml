      <description>Donald Trump said that data suggested America was past the peak of the covid-19 outbreak, as he mooted guidelines to reopen the economy.

China&#39;s ambassador to America said it was &amp;ldquo;harmful&amp;rdquo; to speculate about the origin of covid-19. His remarks appeared aimed at a baseless conspiracy theory, promoted by some Chinese</description>
