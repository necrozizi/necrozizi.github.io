Three of them all in their late 60s or older, have already died.

La Scala opera house and the Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan's most **celebrated** art museum, are also shutting. Giorgio Armani and Laura Biagiotti, two fashion designers, both displayed their autumn and winter collections in the city via live streaming, behind closed doors. The governor of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, said that if the situation **degenerated**, he would **impose** more **draconian** measures, similar to those in Wuhan. Consumers in Italy's business capital, fearing a lockdown, poured into supermarkets to **stock up on** food and other essentials. "We're **working flat out**, **like beasts of burden**," one employee told Ansa, a news agency. Other retailers said they had suffered a drastic fall in sales.

> Mr Salvini, whose party was **ousted** from power last year after he failed to force a general election, seemed to be in no mood to co-operate. "More than a hundred infected in Italy," he wrote on his Facebook page. "Yet, for certain geniuses in the government, up until a few days ago, the problem was Salvini and the League: haters and racists who were **sounding** the alarm for no reason. Shame [on you]!"
