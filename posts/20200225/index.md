> "It is going to be an **almighty** legal mess for months and years to come." That **grim** **prognosis** of the potential legal and business consequences of the viral outbreak in China comes from a **veteran** of the country's **business scene**. Dan Harris of Harris Bricken, an American law firm, worries that today's **trickle** of mainland suppliers declaring **force majeure** (FM), an obscure legal **manoeuvre** used to get out of contracts, could turn into a **tidal wave**.

- almighty
  - [only before noun] 十分严重的

> The crisis has certainly put many firms in a **bind**. If this were a normal year, most factories would have shut for a week **or so** in early February so that **migrant workers** could return to their villages to celebrate Chinese new year. By now, plants would be **roaring** at full **capacity**. But because of a lockdown of a large area around Wuhan, the outbreak's centre, and ongoing restrictions on travel, workers are only slowly trickling back. Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, reckons that production may reach only 60% to 80% of normal levels by the end of February.

> The result is that the supply chains of global firms, which often rely on "**just in time**" deliveries of stocks, are being disrupted. Chinese buyers of imported **commodities** are also hurt, thanks to weak local demand. Nomura, a Japanese bank, thinks Chinese **year-on-year** economic growth could **plunge** to 3% in the first quarter, down from 6% the previous quarter.

> China Inc is **panicking**. Firms are starting to **invoke** FM to avoid paying **non-performance** **penalties** on contracts. On February 17th, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), an official body, revealed that it had already **issued** over 1,600 "FM certificates" to firms in 30 **sectors** covering contracts worth over $15bn. These give official support to its **invocation**. More are likely to come.

> All this raises several questions. First, since this **clause** typically refers to "acts of God" like earthquakes and **hurricanes**, does it really apply to an epidemic probably caused by humans eating **exotic** animals and to the **heavy-handed** government response to it? Second, even if **deemed** relevant, will FM really work in practice? And finally, is a **lengthy** legal **tangle** inevitable?

> On the first question, common sense suggests no but **precedent** and **officialdom** say yes. David Buxbaum of Anderson & Anderson, a lawyer who has worked in China since 1972, reports that some suppliers successfully invoked FM in local courts **in the wake of** the SARS virus outbreak of 2003. On February 10th, the National People's Congress **ruled** that policies **implemented** to control the virus (such as production **curbs** and city lockdowns) that interfere with contracts should be considered FM.

> On whether invoking this clause will really work, legal opinion is divided. Many trading contracts fall under international **jurisdictions** less friendly to this claim than China with courts not **overly** impressed by FM certificates. Earlier this month, CNOOC, a Chinese state-run oil firm, invoked FM in refusing to accept a **shipment** of **liquefied natural gas** from Royal Dutch Shell and *Total* — a claim rejected by the European oil giants. Traders whisper that mainland firms are using the viral outbreak to try to **renegotiate** terms, a tactic they **deride** as "price majeure."

> "FM is a recognised **doctrine** in **civil-law** systems like that of China but is not a doctrine of **common-law** systems, like English law," observes Simmons+Simmons, a British law firm. It is typically only respected by courts in London and Hong Kong if the contract has a specific FM clause. So local firms are likely to get a more **sympathetic** **hearing** in mainland courts. Mr Harris thinks that even if a foreign firm gets a favourable **ruling** overseas, it may still need to get it enforced by a Chinese court. That court will see the FM certificate and likely **rule for** the mainland firm.

> Tobias Larsson of Resilience360, a German supply-chain **consultancy**, thinks that invocation of FM could help make the **fallout** from the virus the "biggest supply-chain disruption since Japan's earthquake." Mayer Brown, an American law firm, worries that use of FM and other legal tactics "may be passed along supply chains around the world, causing firms based in other jurisdiction to seek similar relief."

- fallout
  - the bad results of a situation or an action （不良）后果，余波 

> Still, there is a reason to think legal chaos might be avoided. Unlike during the SARS epidemic, when multinationals could easily shift **sourcing**, Chinese firms are now critical (and sometimes the only) suppliers of vital parts to many industries. John Hoffecker of Alix Partners, a consultancy, says that his clients are more concerned about being the first to receive parts as factories restart than about FM. So foreign bosses may agree to renegotiate terms with certificate-waving **vendors** **through gritted teeth** rather than risk losing them altogether through **bitter** legal battles.
