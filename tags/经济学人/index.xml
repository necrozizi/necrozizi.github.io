    <description><![CDATA[Protests erupted in Hong Kong after an announcement that the National People&rsquo;s Congress, China&rsquo;s rubber-stamp parliament, would impose a national-security law on the territory. The demonstrations were also fuelled by a proposal in the city&rsquo;s legislature to make insulting China&rsquo;s national anthem a crime. Mike Pompeo, America&rsquo;s secretary of state, said that the &ldquo;fact on the ground&rdquo; showed that Hong Kong was no longer autonomous. This could pave the way]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Not all perovskites are semiconductors. But a group based on a metal, such as tin, and a halogen, such as chlorine, bromine or iodine, do have that property. The ingredients of these metal-halide perovskites are, moreover, abundant and inexpensive. One of the leaders in the field of making cells out of them is Oxford PV, a British firm founded in 2010 to exploit work done on perovskites by Henry Snaith]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[One way to boost a cell&rsquo;s efficiency is to add layers tuned to different parts of the solar spectrum. This means reaching beyond silicon to other materials. So-called Ⅲ-Ⅴ semiconductors, made of elements from group Ⅲ of the periodic table (aluminium, gallium and indium) and group Ⅴ (phosphorus and arsenic) are one approach. Indeed, gallium arsenide is already used in applications like satellites. John Geisz and his colleagues]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Solar energy has had a good crisis. In many parts of the world skies clear of pollution have helped photovoltaic power stations, which convert light into electricity, become more productive and reliable. Declining demand, meanwhile, has seen coal- and gas-fired stations taken offline. In Britain, on April 20th, solar generation peaked at 9.7 gigawatts. At the moment this happened that represented almost 30% of the country&rsquo;s electricity sup]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[At the World Health Oraganisation&rsquo;s annual summit (held remotely), China accepted an Australian-led motion calling for an inquiry into the origins of covid-19.
