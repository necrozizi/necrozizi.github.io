<p>With <strong>disconcerting</strong> suddenness, Italy has found itself the European country worst affected by covid-19. By February 23rd the number of people infected with the coronavirus that first <strong>emerged</strong> in the Chinese city of Wuhan had <strong>leapt</strong> to 152, jump of around 100 within a day. Three of them all in their late 60s or older, have already died. Italy now has the third-most cases in the world, after China itself, where 77,000 have been infected, and South Korea, where the total has <strong>surged</strong> to more than 600.</p>
<ul>
<li>disconcert</li>
<li>emerge</li>
<li>leap</li>
<li>surge</li>
</ul>
<p>Two <strong>clusters</strong> of infection have emerged, both in the north. One is south-east of Milan, around the town of Codogno; the other is south-west of Venice, near Padua. Both areas have been <strong>quarantined</strong>, restricting the movement of around 50,000 people. An extra 500 police officers have been sent to <strong>carry out</strong> <strong>patrols</strong> and <strong>man</strong> roadblocks on roads to and from the two areas.</p>

</ul>
<p>Four of Sunday's Serie A football matches, all at northern grounds, were called off. The government in Rome <strong>slapped</strong> a ban on school <strong>excursions</strong>. Luca Zaia, the governor of Veneto, the region that <strong>encompasses</strong> Venice, announced that he was bringing the city's <strong>renowned</strong> carnival to an end at midnight of February 23rd, <strong>thereby</strong> cancelling the last two days of a festival that draws around 3m visitors every year. Mr Zaia also said he was shutting the city's museums and <strong>suspending</strong> all other events involving crowds. He acknowledged the measures he had approved were <strong>drastic</strong>. But he added: &ldquo;We want to prevent and not cure.&rdquo;</p>

<li>excursion</li>
<li>encompass</li>

</ul>
<p>In neighbouring Lombardy, the region around Milan, <strong>nurseries</strong>, schools and universities will not reopen for at least a week. La Scala opera house and the Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan's most <strong>celebrated</strong> art museum, are also shutting. Giorgio Armani and Laura Biagiotti, two fashion designers, both displayed their autumn and winter collections in the city via live streaming, behind closed doors. The governor of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, said that if the situation <strong>degenerated</strong>, he would <strong>impose</strong> more <strong>draconian</strong> measures, similar to those in Wuhan. Consumers in Italy's business capital, fearing a lockdown, poured into supermarkets to <strong>stock up on</strong> food and other essentials. &ldquo;We're <strong>working flat out</strong>, <strong>like beasts of burden</strong>,&rdquo; one employee told Ansa, a news agency. Other retailers said they had suffered a drastic fall in sales.</p>

<li>like beasts of burden</li>
</ul>
<p>Italian <strong>health authorities</strong> had thought that they had identified the source of the outbreak: an <strong>executive</strong> who returned from China on January 21st. But he has since tested negative for the virus; on February 22nd it emerged there was no evidence <strong>so far</strong> to suggest he had developed antibodies. That leaves open the question of who brought the disease to Italy and <strong>complicates</strong> efforts to <strong>contain</strong> the outbreak.</p>

<li>health authorities</li>

<li>contain</li>
</ul>
<p>The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said he had been surprised by what he called an &ldquo;explosion of cases&rdquo;. Mr Conte appealed for cross-party <strong>unity</strong> in <strong>facing up to</strong> the emergency. In an apparent reference to the head of the <strong>hard-right</strong> Northern League, Matteo Salvini, he said that he had informed the leader of <strong>the opposition</strong> of the measures his government was taking.</p>
<ul>
<li>unity</li>
<li>face up to</li>
<li>hard-right</li>
<li>the opposition</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr Salvini, whose party was <strong>ousted</strong> from power last year after he failed to force a general election, seemed to be in no mood to co-operate. &ldquo;More than a hundred infected in Italy,&rdquo; he wrote on his Facebook page. &ldquo;Yet, for certain geniuses in the government, up until a few days ago, the problem was Salvini and the League: haters and racists who were <strong>sounding</strong> the alarm for no reason. Shame [on you]!&rdquo; The health scare looks more likely to <strong>intensify</strong> Italy's <strong>bitter</strong> political division than to ease them.</p>
